Part One: Lost and Found

This is the first part of an ARG I'll be developing under the working title *Mendelworth's.*

I have a surface level idea of what things need to look like with the narrative, but an ever-evolving idea of the interacting domains.

So, step one will be a generic lost and found database for now.

I'm using:
- ReactJS
- Tailwind, easy peasy pretty UI.
- NextJS for SSR, probably a bit OP but I'd like to expand on what I know.
- Diving into Supabase for the items.
